# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

Data structures are a systematic way to organise data in order to use it efficiently.

### Foundation Terms

* __Interface__ - Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents set of operations that a data structure can support. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations

* __Implementation__ - Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure

* __Correctness__ - Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly

* __Time Complexity__ - Running time the execution time of operations should be as small as possible

* __Space Complexity__ - The memory usage of a data structure should be small as possible

### Need for Data Structure

Data structures help solve many issues faced by modern applications such as:

* __Data Search__ - For example, searching through an inventory of a large amount of items will slow down if one item is needed. As data grows, the search will become slower

* __Processor speed__ -  Although fast, it falls limited if the data grows to a very large number

* __Multiple Requests__ - As many users search for data simultaneously on a web server, this can make even fast servers fail due to multiple requests

Data structures help solve these issues by organising data in such ways where for instance, searches can be made where all items aren't required to search and the required data can be retrieved almost instantly

### Execution Time Cases

* __Best Case__ - The least possible execution time a particular data structure takes. For example, in a simple linear list search its best case occurs when the desired element is the first element on the list.

* __Average Case__ - The average time a particular data structure operation takes. If an operation takes f(n) in execution, then _m_ will take mf(n) time.

* __Worst Case__ - The maximum time a particular data structure operation takes. This is represented with f(n) which represents the operations worst possible time, where f(n) represents a function of n. For example, in a simple linear list search, its worst case occurs when its desired element is the last element on the list.

### Basic Terminology

* __Data__ - Data are values or sets of values

* __Data Item__ - Data item refers to a single unit of values

* __Group Items__ - Data items that are divided into sub items are called *Group Items*

* __Elementary Items__ - Data items that cannot be divided are called Elementary Items

* __Attribute and Entity__ - An entity is what contains certain properties called attributes, which may be assigned values

* __Entity Set__ - Entities of similiar attributes form an entity set

* __Field__ - A single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.

* __Record__ - A collection of field values of a given entity

* __File__ - A collection of records of the entities in a given entity set


## Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step process that results in a desired output, which is used for calculations or for solving problems. Typically, algorithms are created independent of a particular language, allowing it to be implemented across multiple programming languages.
