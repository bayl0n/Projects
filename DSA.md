# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

Data structures are a systematic way to organise data in order to use it efficiently.

### Foundation Terms

* __Interface__ - Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents set of operations that a data structure can support. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations

* __Implementation__ - Implementation provides the internal representation of data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure

* __Correctness__ - Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly

* __Time Complexity__ - Running time the execution time of operations should be as small as possible

* __Space Complexity__ - The memory usage of a data structure should be small as possible
