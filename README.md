# What is this for?

This was created for the purpose of having a way to track all of my programming progress. This is aimed for projects small enough that it doesn't warrant its own repository. Bigger projects will be put on separate repositories.

# When was this created?

This was created 25th of August, 2018

# What will be found here?

Programming projects either from Python or other languages that I learn in the future
